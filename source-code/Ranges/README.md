# Ranges

Ranges help to deal more conveniently with STL containers, and the
composition of algorithms.  Part of this functionality is rolled into
the C++20 standard.

## What is it?
1. `simple.cpp`: very simple example of using ranges.
1. `transform_accumulate.cpp`: simple example of chaining a
    transformation and an accumulator on a vector.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.

*Note:* you will need at least g++ 10.x to compile this succesfully.
