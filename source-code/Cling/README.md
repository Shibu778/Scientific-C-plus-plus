# Cling

Cling is an interactive interpreter for C++ based on the Clang compiler.
Cling can be used on the command line, but also in Jupyter notebooks using
the [Xeus-cling kernel](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/).

Kernels are available for C++11, C++14 and C++17 (the underlying Clang version
at this point is 9.x).


## What is it?

1. `cling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustraing C++ in a notebook.
1. `environment.yml`: conda environment specification file.
