# Error handling

Code illustrations for chapter 3, Modularity in Stroustrup's
"A tour of C++" on error handling using exceptions.

# What is it?
1. `fac.cpp`: illustrates exception handling.
1. `Makefile`: make file for these examples.
1. `Expected`: illustrates error handling using `std::expected`.
1. `MemoryLeak`: illustrates how inappropriately handled exceptions can
   lead to memory leaks, and how to fix that.
