# Matrices

A very simple class that implements a matrix data structure
to illustrate the rule of five.  It also illustrates using
`std::span` to create a view on the underlying data.


## What is it?

1. `matrices.h`: class declaration.
1. `matrix_test.cpp`: main function to illustrate the usage
   of the class.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
