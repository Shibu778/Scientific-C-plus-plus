# UserDefinedTypes
Code illustrations for chapter 2, User defined types in Stroustrup's
"A tour of C++".

# What is it?
1. `struct_particles.cpp`: implementation of particles as struct
    data type.
1. `class_particles.cpp`: implementation of particles as class.
1. `charge_particles.cpp`: Illustration of an enum class, extending the
    original `Particle` class with charge.
1. `stats.h`: `Stats` class definition that keeps statistics for steraming
    data (very bare bones, just illustration).
1. `function_objects.cpp`: illustration of overloading the `operator()` to
    create function objects.
1. `placement_new.cpp`: illustration of placement new with timing.
1. `streamin_stats.cpp`: implementation of `Stats` class for statistics
    on streaming data..
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applictions.
1. `ObjectLifeCycle`: illustration of object life cycle.
1. `TableStats`: Example of using STL data structures.
1. `RuleOfFive`: Illustration of the rule of five when resource handling
   is required.
1. `Matrices`: another illustration of the rule of five, using smart pointers.
